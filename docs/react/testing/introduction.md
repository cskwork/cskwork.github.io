# Testing Ionic React

This document provides an overview of how to test an application built with `@ionic/react`. It covers the basics of testing with React, as well as the specific tools and libraries used in `@ionic/react`.

## Introduction

Testing is an important part of the development process, and it helps to ensure that an application is working as intended. In `@ionic/react`, testing is done using a combination of tools and libraries, including Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress.

## Tools and Libraries

**Jest**: Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications. It's used to run unit tests and integration tests.

**React Testing Library**: React Testing Library is a set of utilities that make it easier to test React components. It's used to interact with components and test their behavior.

**Cypress**: Cypress is a modern testing tool that's used to run end-to-end tests. It allows developers to test the entire application, including the user interface, in a simulated environment.

## Types of Tests

There are two types of tests that can be written:

**Unit Tests**: Unit tests are used to test individual functions and components in isolation. They are typically written using Jest and React Testing Library.

**Integration Tests**: Integration tests are used to test how different components work together. They are typically written using Cypress.

## Conclusion

Testing is an important part of the development process, and React provides a robust set of tools and libraries for testing applications. By writing and running tests, you can ensure that your application is working as intended and catch bugs before they reach production.
